;*** 24 Pilot infos ***
.busy .msg $aircraft Hello. I am currently too busy to help you or to answer your question. Please refer to the manuals on vatsim.net/pilots or to vacc.ch or try to find another person who can help you.
.cr .msg $aircraft Please make a correct readback so that I see that you've understood my instructions correctly. A readback is made by repeating the instructions of the controller. 
.po .msg $aircraft Hello, the position you are standing is already occupied by another aircraft. Please choose another one. Thank you!
.rte .msg $aircraft Hello. Your IFR flight plan is not valid. Please check for a valid route at routes.vacc.ch or vroute.net. Thank you!
.fpr .msg $aircraft Hello. Your filed route is subject to restrictions you do not comply with currently. Please refer to our charts on charts.vacc.ch/$dep#charts (category departure) and refile via $1. Find validated routes on routes.vacc.ch and vroute.net.
.fph .msg $aircraft To support accurate and compliant flight planning, we provide charts on charts.vacc.ch. Please find validated routes on routes.vacc.ch or vroute.net.
.sc .msg $aircraft Hello. It seems you are using an inappropriate (default) scenery for $uc($1) resulting in an offset to other pilots. For better experience, consider using one of the (freeware) sceneries listed on our website charts.vacc.ch/$uc($1)#sceneries.
.rp .msg $aircraft Startup does NOT include pushback. This first movement needs a separate clearance. Always request pushback, please. Thank you!
.cf .msg $aircraft The facing indicates the direction your nose should point to after the pushback is completed.
.ica .msg $aircraft A kindly reminder: the Initial Climb Altitude in Zurich is always 5000ft! Please read the charts (charts.vacc.ch/LSZH) carefully and comply with the altitude restrictions to avoid loss of separation causing alerts for both controllers/pilots.
.ica2 .msg $aircraft No FMC/FMS knows the Initial Climb Altitude of any SID as this piece of data is not part of the ARINC 429 standard. Charts are ALWAYS needed (any form), also in reality. Keep in mind: YOU are the pilot! YOU fly the aircraft, not vice versa.
.exg .msg $aircraft Hello, expect Gate $1, Happy Landing!
.exs .msg $aircraft Hello, expect Stand $1, Happy Landing!
.xp .msg $aircraft It seems you are using XPlane with inappropriate graphic settings. Your computer is not able to render the requested number of frames in time thus slowing down your simulator. Please adjust your graphic settings to increase the frame rate.
.cs .msg $aircraft Your call sign looks different from our recommendation. Perhaps you are not yet familiar how to choose a call sign. For detailed information and guidance, please visit vatsim.net/pilot-resource-centre/general-lessons/choosing-callsign.
